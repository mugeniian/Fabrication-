    <h1> Welding and Fabrication World</h1>
    <p>Welding and fabrication are important processes in engineering and construction industries. Welding involves joining two or more metal pieces together using heat and pressure, while fabrication involves creating structures and products from raw materials. These processes are vital for creating various products ranging from buildings to machines.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Welding</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gas Metal Arc Welding (MIG)</li>
        <li>Shielded Metal Arc Welding (Stick)</li>
        <li>Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (TIG)</li>
        <li>Flux-Cored Arc Welding</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Fabrication Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cutting</li>
        <li>Bending</li>
        <li>Assembling</li>
        <li>Welding</li>
        <li>Finishing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Welding and fabrication require skilled professionals and specialized equipment to ensure quality and precision in the final products.</p>
